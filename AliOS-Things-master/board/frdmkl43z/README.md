## Steps to download and run the yts case

1. Due to the limitation of RAM size(32k only) and over head of test case, below change was needed:
   - In the file of test/testcase/certificate_test/aos_test.c：
     > Change the TEST_CONFIG_YLOOP_EVENT_COUNT" from 1000 to 10.
2. Run the command to build the image:
   > "aos make yts@fremkl43z test=certificate"
3. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
4. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
5. Download the program to the target board.
6. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
7. If the test case run successfully, you can see all the test cases run pass.

## Update log
- Initial update (7-20-2018):
  > Porting the alios to frdmkl43z board, the yts case can run pass on this board.
