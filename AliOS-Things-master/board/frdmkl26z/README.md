## Steps to download and run the yts case.

1. Due to the limitation of RAM size(16Kb only), please do the changes the files like below:
   - In file test/testcase/certificate_test/aos_test.c:
     > Change TEST_CONFIG_YLOOP_EVENT_COUNT to 50
     > Change TEST_CONFIG_YLOOP_LOOP_COUNT  to 2
   - In file tools/cli/cli.c:
     > Change CONFIG_AOS_CLI_STACK_SIZE to 1024
   - In file include/aos/cli.h:
     > Change OUTBUF_SIZE to 256
2. Run the command to build the image:
   > "aos make yts@fremkl26z test=certificate"
3. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
4. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
5. Download the program to the target board.
6. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
7. If the test case run successfully, you can see yts test case run pass.
