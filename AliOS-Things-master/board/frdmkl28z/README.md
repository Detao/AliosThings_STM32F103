## Steps to download and run the yts case.

1. Run the command to build the image:
   > "aos make yts@fremkl43z test=certificate"
2. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
3. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
4. Download the program to the target board.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
6. If the test case run successfully, you can see yts test case run pass.
